# The World Happiness Report and Geography

### Introduction
Does the physical location of a country affect the happiness of its population?
The World Happiness Report surveys individuals across the globe about their "happiness" and derives a score for each county.
This project examines the geographic location of each country in the Report with respect to it's  Ladder score.
Northern countries seem to be more happy.

The World Happiness Report reviews the state of happiness in the world today and shows how the "science of happiness" explains personal and national variations in happiness.
The scores are based on peoples assessments of their lives in each country.
Individuals are asked the Cantril Ladder question:
*Imagining a ladder with 10 steps, 10 being the best possible life, on which step do you see yourself?*

This R project looks at the latitude and longitude of each country to try and determine if there is a relationship between
the geographic location of a country and it's Ladder Happiness score.
